November 6th 2018 - In terms of my project schedule, I am currently on track, today my PCB was made and retrieved. I was able to obtain my sockets through the prototype lab, so changes have to be made to the budget. I was able to solder everything required, without any issues, I am prepared for next week milestone.

October 29 2018 - After connecting the raspberry pi to the TV at my home, the raspberry pi does work. Perhaps there was a issue with the hdmi to dvi unfortante, but thankfully I was able to identify and display my i2c (0x40) onto my pi and wireless VNC connection onto the laptop was met.<br>
