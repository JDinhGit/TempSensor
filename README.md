October 29 2018 - After connecting the raspberry pi to the TV at my home, the raspberry pi does work. Perhaps there was a issue with the hdmi to dvi unfortante, but thankfully I was able to identify and display my i2c (0x40) onto my pi and wireless VNC connection onto the laptop was met. 

October 23 2018 - I managed to properly solder my i2c onto my breadboard, fritzing diagram, and raspberry pi pins number displayed. But unfortunately the raspberry pi failed to boot up.
